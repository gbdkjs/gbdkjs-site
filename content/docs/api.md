GBDK.js isn't yet a full implementation of the GBDK C library. If it isn't in
one of our example projects, chances are we haven't implemented the
functionality but we're getting to it (e.g. No GameBoy Color support and not
much support for banks yet)

For now you can refer to the documentation at  
http://gbdk.sourceforge.net/doc/html/files.html
