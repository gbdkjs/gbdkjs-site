To get started with GBDK.js we've created a boilerplate example project that you
can clone as a starting point for your own games.

```
> git clone git@github.com:gbdkjs/gbdkjs-example-platformer.git
> cd gbdkjs-example-platformer
> npm install
```

You can now build this project as a GameBoy ROM file.

```
> make rom
> open open build/gb/game.gb
```

You should see the example application open in your GameBoy emulator.

```
> make web
> live-server --wait=2000 build/web
```

If you don't have `live-server` you can install it with

```
> npm -g install live-server
```

or you can use something like `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` or any number of
web server applications. Unfortunately you can't just open the `index.html`
directly as you'll get a cross origin error.


## The graphics assets

If you have [ggbgfx](/docs/ggbgfx) installed you'll be able to modify the
graphics files and rebuild the game with your own assets.

Try editing the file `assets/platformer.png` and copy paste some of the
platforms to new locations. Remember to keep the tiles on an 8x8 pixel grid,
and don't add any platforms above the exit because it *will* break things.

```
> cd assets
> sh build.sh
> cd ..
> make clean
> make web
> live-server --wait=2000 build/web
```

## The code

The most important files in the boilerplate are the following

- **src/game.c** The main game code file, contains all game logic and the run
  loop.

- **include/game.h** The game headers and library includes.

- **Makefile** The compile scripts for building your game, until you start
  adding more files or want to replace the Emscripten shell file you shouldn't
  need to change this.

- **assets/build.sh** A build script for compiling PNG assets into the
  GameBoy graphics format.

- **include/assets.h** An autogenerated file created by the assets build script
  containing your game's graphics data. As your game's graphics data increases
  you'll want to move these into separate files and in probably into other
  [banks](http://gbdk.sourceforge.net/doc/html/c0303.html).
